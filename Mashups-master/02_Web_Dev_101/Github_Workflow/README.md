Github Workflow
------------------

[Understanding Git basics](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basic)

You can use either the [Command Line](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) to execute these steps or the [Github Desktop client](https://desktop.github.com/). I will cover how to use the Desktop client here.

**Assignment Workflow**  
   1. To start, [**fork** the homework repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).    
   2. Go to your repos and navigate to the forked repo that you now own. Click the 'Clone and Download' button, then choose 'Open in Desktop'. Confirm on Desktop that you want to clone the package.   
   3. Modify the files.
   4. Select which files you want to submit by ticking/unticking the blue check box next to its name. You can preview the changes you've made in the window to the right.    
   5. Write a summary of the changes you are making next to your profile picture.    
   6. Commit the changes. You can do this more than once before you turn in your code. It's a good idea to do this every time you make substantial changes to your work.    
   7. Click the 'Push' tab when you are ready to submit your code.    
   8. [Create a **pull request**](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) on the original repository to turn in the assignment. You will need to click the link that says 'Compare Across All forks.' Once you do, Choose your name from the dropdown menu titled 'head fork' for your name.    
   9. Use the description field to include this week's journal (or a link to a blog post) or include it in your README.md file.  
   10. Do not merge the Pull Request.
