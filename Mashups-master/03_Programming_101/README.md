#### IV. Discussion - Project #1 Due Class 6 (Monday 3/19)
* Create a single web page experience that, upon user input, responds with data from at least 2 web apis. One possible approach to this assignment would be to design the experience around answering a question for the user. An example of this is [doineedanumbrella.com](http://doineedanumbrella.com/). But **(1)** a user needs to "trigger" an event, **(2)** data needs to be requested via AJAX from two APIs, and **(3)** the page should update appropriately. Your completed assignment should include a .html file, a .css file, and a .js file.

#### VI. Homework
* Read - [What Is Code?](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code)
* Learn - Eloquent Javascript Chapters [One](http://eloquentjavascript.net/01_values.html) and [Two](http://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html)
* Watch - [Lynda.com - Introducing the Javascript Language: Section 6 Functions - Basic Uses of Functions (4 mins))](https://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-tutorials/Welcome/81266/87513-4.html)
* Explore - [Tuts - Design School for Developers](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/series/design-school-for-developers--webdesign-13793)
* Answer - the first 2 code exercises at the end of [Eloquent JS 2nd Edition Preview Ch.2 - Looping A Triangle and FizzBuzz](http://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html). You can run the code by writing in your browser's web console (In Chrome, go to View --> Developer --> Javascript console and type on the command line). You are encouraged to work in pairs. Submit your work by sending your answers to me as a Direct Message on Slack (typing 3 backticks before and after your code will make it render `pretty`).
